# Remember Their Words
At a certain point in your child's development, it might become harder to keep up with how fast they learn new words, gestures, etc. You can enter these things into the program, along with a timestamp. You can then do things like view the whole list or randomly pull a word from the list to ask your child about. Words are stored in a SQLite database and can be exported to a txt file.
